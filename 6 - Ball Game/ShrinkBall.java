/******************************************************************************
 *  This is a larger ball which gets smaller by 33% (i.e., 2/3 of the original size) 
    each time the player hits it. Similar to BasicBall, after each hit, the ball 
    will be moved to its initial location and it will be assigned a random speed. 

    When the ball size is less than or equal to 25% of the initial size the ball, 
    the ball will be reset to its original size and it will start from the middle of the 
    screen with a random initial speed. 

    A hit to a shrink ball will increase the playerâ€™s score by 20 points.
